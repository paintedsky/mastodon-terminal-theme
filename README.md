# Mastodon Terminal Theme

Custom Tampermonkey theme for Mastodon instances that looks roughly like a terminal.

To install, make a new Userscript in Tampermonkey and replace the boilerplate code with the contents of masto-term-theme.js. Update or add to the @match entries in the header if you'd like to include additional instances.

Work in progress- feel free to make PRs or issues for further development work.

Cheers! :)
